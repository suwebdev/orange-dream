Google Sight Search Code

Instructions for site search deployment:
Copy the following code, and paste it into a <div> element in the site's <body> section, where the search box will render. 
I've set the results page to display as an overlay so the search bar can be placed in the navigation bar or anywhere 
else in the site's body. For a live example of this set up visit: www.ecowatch.com

Note: For the most cross-browser compatibility, it is recommended that HTML pages use a supported doctype such as 
<!DOCTYPE html>. CSS hover effects require a supported doctype.



<script>
  (function() {
    var cx = '015851646298580987134:lmvxd65ane0';
    var gcse = document.createElement('script');
    gcse.type = 'text/javascript';
    gcse.async = true;
    gcse.src = 'https://cse.google.com/cse.js?cx=' + cx;
    var s = document.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];
    s.parentNode.insertBefore(gcse, s);
  })();
</script>
<gcse:search></gcse:search>



NOTE:
Search customization, including colors, page layout, etc. are available. These can be optimized by Jens through Google 
without any script manipulation.
