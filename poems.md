**Awaking in New York** <br>
*Shaker, Why Don’t You Sing, 1983* <br>
<br>
Curtains forcing their will <br>
against the wind, <br>
children sleep, <br>
exchanging dreams with <br>  
seraphim. The city <br>
drags itself awake on <br>
subway straps; and <br>
I, an alarm, awake as a <br>
rumor of war, <br>
lie stretching into dawn, <br>   
unasked and unheeded. <br>

**The Mothering Blackness** <br>
*Just Give Me a Cool Drink of Water Fore I Die, 1971* <br>
<br>
She came home running <br>
       back to the mothering blackness <br> 
       deep in the smothering blackness<br>
white tears icicle gold plains of her face <br>  
       She came home running <br>
<br>

She came down creeping <br>
       here to the black arms waiting <br>
       now to the warm heart waiting <br>
rime of alien dreams befrosts her rich brown face <br>   
       She came down creeping <br>
<br>
She came home blameless <br>
       black yet as Hagar’s daughter <br>
       tall as was Sheba’s daughter <br>
threats of northern winds die on the desert’s face<br>   
       She came home blameless</p> <br>

**Phenomenal Woman** <br>
*And Still I Rise, 1978* <br>
<br>
Pretty women wonder where my secret lies. <br>
I’m not cute or built to suit a fashion model’s size <br>   
But when I start to tell them, <br>
They think I’m telling lies. <br>
I say, <br>
It’s in the reach of my arms, <br>
The span of my hips, <br>
The stride of my step, <br>
The curl of my lips. <br>
I’m a woman <br>
Phenomenally. <br>
Phenomenal woman, <br>  
That’s me. <br>
<br>
I walk into a room <br>
Just as cool as you please, <br>   
And to a man, <br>
The fellows stand or <br>
Fall down on their knees. <br>   
Then they swarm around me, <br>
A hive of honey bees. <br>
I say, <br>
It’s the fire in my eyes, <br>   
And the flash of my teeth, <br>
The swing in my waist, <br>
And the joy in my feet. <br>
I’m a woman <br>
Phenomenally. <br>
<br>
Phenomenal woman, <br>
That’s me. <br>
<br>
Men themselves have wondered <br>   
What they see in me. <br>
They try so much <br>
But they can’t touch <br>
My inner mystery. <br>
When I try to show them, <br>   
They say they still can’t see. <br>   
I say, <br>
It’s in the arch of my back, <br>   
The sun of my smile, <br>
The ride of my breasts, <br>
The grace of my style. <br>
I’m a woman <br>
Phenomenally. <br>
Phenomenal woman, <br>
That’s me. <br>
<br>
Now you understand <br>
Just why my head’s not bowed. <br>   
I don’t shout or jump about <br>
Or have to talk real loud. <br>  
When you see me passing, <br>
It ought to make you proud. <br>
I say, <br>
It’s in the click of my heels, <br>  
The bend of my hair, <br>   
the palm of my hand, <br>   
The need for my care. <br>   
’Cause I’m a woman <br>
Phenomenally. <br>
Phenomenal woman, <br>
That’s me. <br>

<br>
**Burnt Ships** <br>
*1871, Translation Lyrics and Poems from Ibsen, 1912* <br>
<br>
O skies that were brighter <br>
Turned he his prows; <br>
To gods that were lighter <br>
Made he his vows. <br>
<br>
The snow-land's mountains <br>
Sank in the deep; <br>
Sunnier fountains <br>
Lulled him to sleep. <br>
 <br>
He burns his vessels, <br>
The smoke flung forth <br>
On blue cloud-trestles <br>
A bridge to the north. <br>
 <br>
From the sun-warmed lowland <br>
Each night that betides, <br>
To the huts of the snow-land <br>
A horseman rides. <br>
<br>

**The Miner**<br>
*1851, Translation Lyrics and Poems from Ibsen, 1912*<br>
<br>
Beetling rock, with roar and smoke <br>
Break before my hammer-stroke! <br>
Deeper I must thrust and lower <br>
Till I hear the ring of ore. <br>
<br> 
From the mountain's unplumbed night, <br>
Deep amid the gold-veins bright, <br>
Diamonds lure me, rubies beckon, <br>
Treasure-hoard that none may reckon. <br>
<br>
There is peace within the deep-- <br>
Peace and immemorial sleep; <br>
Heavy hammer, burst as bidden, <br>
To the heart-nook of the hidden! <br>
<br>
Once I, too, a careless lad, <br>
Under starry heavens was glad, <br>
Trod the primrose paths of summer, <br>
Child-like knew not care nor cummer. <br>
<br>
But I lost the sense of light <br>
In the poring womb of night; <br>
Woodland songs, when earth rejoiced her, <br>
Breathed not down my hollow cloister. <br>
<br>
Fondly did I cry, when first <br>
Into the dark place I burst: <br>
"Answer spirits of the middle <br>
Earth, my life's unending riddle!--" <br>
<br>
Still the spirits of the deep <br>
Unrevealed their answer keep; <br>
Still no beam from out the gloomy <br>
Cavern rises to illume me. <br>
<br>
Have I erred? Does this way lead <br>
Not to clarity indeed? <br>
If above I seek to find it, <br>
By the glare my eyes are blinded. <br>
<br> 
Downward, then! the depths are best; <br>
There is immemorial rest. <br>
Heavy hammer burst as bidden <br>
To the heart-nook of the hidden!-- <br>
<br>
Hammer-blow on hammer-blow <br>
Till the lamp of life is low. <br>
Not a ray of hope's fore-warning; <br>
Not a glimmer of the morning. <br>
<br>
**To The Survivors** <br>
*1860, Translation Lyrics and Poems from Ibsen, 1912* <br>
<br>
Now they sing the hero loud; -- <br>
But they sing him in his shroud. <br>
<br>
Torch he kindled for his land; <br>
On his brow ye set its brand. <br>
<br>
Taught by him to wield a glaive; <br>
Through his heart the steel ye drave. <br>
<br>
Trolls he smote in hard-fought fields; <br>
Ye bore him down 'twixt traitor shields. <br>
<br>
But the shining spoils he won, <br>
These ye treasure as your own.-- <br>
<br>
Dim them not, that so the dead <br>
Rest appeased his thorn-crowned head. <br>
<br>

#W.B. Yeats#
<br>
<br>
**A Coat** <br>
*Poetry Magazine, 1914* <br>
<br>
I made my song a coat <br>
Covered with embroideries <br>
Out of old mythologies <br>
From heel to throat; <br>
But the fools caught it, <br>
Wore it in the world’s eyes <br>
As though they’d wrought it. <br>
Song, let them take it <br>
For there’s more enterprise <br> 
In walking naked. <br>
<br>

**A Dialogue of Self and Soul** <br>
*The Poems of W.B. Yeats: A New Edition, 1933* <br>
<br>
I <br>
My Soul. I summon to the winding ancient stair; <br>
   Set all your mind upon the steep ascent, <br>
   Upon the broken, crumbling battlement, <br>
   Upon the breathless starlit air, <br>
   Upon the star that marks the hidden pole; <br>
   Fix every wandering thought upon <br>
   That quarter where all thought is done: <br>
   Who can distinguish darkness from the soul? <br>
<br>
My Self. The consecrated blade upon my knees <br>
   Is Sato's ancient blade, still as it was, <br>
   Still razor-keen, still like a looking-glass <br>
   Unspotted by the centuries; <br>
   That flowering, silken, old embroidery, torn <br>
   From some court-lady's dress and round <br>
   The wooden scabbard bound and wound, <br>
   Can, tattered, still protect, faded adorn. <br>
<br>
My Soul. Why should the imagination of a man <br>
   Long past his prime remember things that are <br>
   Emblematical of love and war? <br>
   Think of ancestral night that can, <br>
   If but imagination scorn the earth <br>
   And intellect its wandering <br>
   To this and that and t'other thing, <br>
   Deliver from the crime of death and birth. <br>
<br>
My Self. Montashigi, third of his family, fashioned it <br>
   Five hundred years ago, about it lie <br>
   Flowers from I know not what embroidery— <br>
   Heart's purple—and all these I set <br>
   For emblems of the day against the tower <br>
   Emblematical of the night, <br>
   And claim as by a soldier's right <br>
   A charter to commit the crime once more. <br>
<br>
My Soul. Such fullness in that quarter overflows <br>
   And falls into the basin of the mind <br>
   That man is stricken deaf and dumb and blind, <br>
   For intellect no longer knows <br>
   Is from the Ought, or Knower from the Known— <br>
   That is to say, ascends to Heaven; <br>
   Only the dead can be forgiven; <br>
   But when I think of that my tongue's a stone. <br>
<br>
II <br>
My Self. A living man is blind and drinks his drop. <br>
What matter if the ditches are impure? <br>
What matter if I live it all once more? <br>
Endure that toil of growing up; <br>
The ignominy of boyhood; the distress <br>
Of boyhood changing into man; <br>
The unfinished man and his pain <br>
Brought face to face with his own clumsiness; <br>
<br>
The finished man among his enemies?— <br>
How in the name of Heaven can he escape <br>
That defiling and disfigured shape <br>
The mirror of malicious eyes <br>
Casts upon his eyes until at last <br>
He thinks that shape must be his shape? <br>
And what's the good of an escape <br>
If honour find him in the wintry blast? <br>
<br>
I am content to live it all again <br>
And yet again, if it be life to pitch <br>
Into the frog-spawn of a blind man's ditch, <br>
A blind man battering blind men; <br>
Or into that most fecund ditch of all, <br>
The folly that man does <br>
Or must suffer, if he woos <br>
A proud woman not kindred of his soul. <br>
<br>
I am content to follow to its source <br>
Every event in action or in thought; <br>
Measure the lot; forgive myself the lot! <br>
When such as I cast out remorse <br>
So great a sweetness flows into the breast <br>
We must laugh and we must sing, <br>
We are blest by everything, <br>
Everything we look upon is blest. <br>
<br>

**The Song of Wandering Aengus** <br>
*The Wind Among the Reeds, 1899* <br>
<br>
I went out to the hazel wood, <br>
Because a fire was in my head, <br>
And cut and peeled a hazel wand, <br>
And hooked a berry to a thread; <br>
And when white moths were on the wing, <br>
And moth-like stars were flickering out, <br>
I dropped the berry in a stream <br>
And caught a little silver trout. <br>
<br>
When I had laid it on the floor <br>
I went to blow the fire a-flame, <br>
But something rustled on the floor, <br>
And someone called me by my name: <br>
It had become a glimmering girl <br>
With apple blossom in her hair <br>
Who called me by my name and ran <br>
And faded through the brightening air. <br>
<br>
Though I am old with wandering <br>
Through hollow lands and hilly lands, <br>
I will find out where she has gone, <br>
And kiss her lips and take her hands; <br>
And walk among long dappled grass, <br>
And pluck till time and times are done, <br>
The silver apples of the moon, <br>
The golden apples of the sun. <br>
